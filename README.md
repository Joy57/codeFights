# codeFights

The CodeFights platform has six distinct game modes: Interview Practice, Company Bots, Arcade, Tournaments, Head to Head, and Challenges. 

In all of these modes, the CodeFights system runs a userâ€™s solution to a coding challenge against tests, and the solution is only accepted when all test cases are satisfied.

The first game mode on the platform was an early version of Head to Head, which appealed to competitive programmers.
